### how to chroot, simple and fast ###

Pick up a liveCD, version doesn't matter,
use any distro, as long as it ables you to enter to console.

1. Run with root or sudo than Create a mountpoint
# mkdir /mount_point

2. Mount filesystem
# mount /dev/sdb1 /mount_point

3. Mount /proc /sys /dev to chroot
# mount -o bind /proc /mount_point/proc
# mount -o bind /dev /mount_point/dev
# mount -o bind /dev/pts /mount_point/dev/pts
# mount -o bind /sys /mount_point/sys

4. Copy resolv.conf to networking
# cp /etc/resolv.conf /mount_point/etc/resolv.conf

5.Open bash in chroot
# chroot /mount_point /bin/bash

6. Do what you have to do and then exit chroot
# exit
