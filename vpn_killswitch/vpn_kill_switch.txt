sudo apt install ufw
sudo ifconfig

# After you’ve ensured that your VPN is using tun0, disconnect from it, and copy
# and paste this into your favourite text editor, before saving it as your
# filename of choice (such as firewall.sh) in your home folder:


#!/bin/bash

sudo ufw reset
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default deny outgoing
sudo ufw allow out on tun0 from any to any
sudo ufw enable


# What this script does is reset all your ufw firewall rules, and then change
# them to only allow traffic to go in or out on tun0. Of course, you’ll
# eventually need to undo this. For that, you’ll want to copy and paste the
# following into a text editor as well, and save it in your home folder
# (I called mine unfirewall.sh):


#!/bin/bash

sudo ufw reset
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw enable
