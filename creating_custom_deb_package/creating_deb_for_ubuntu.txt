 How to make a "Basic" .deb



Decide on the name of your package. Standard debian notation is all
lowercase in the following format:

    <project>_<major version>.<minor version>-<package revision>

For example, you could name your first package...

    helloworld_1.0-1

Create a directory to make your package in. The name should be the same as the package name.

    mkdir helloworld_1.0-1

Pretend that the packaging directory is actually the root of the file system. Put the files of your program where they would be installed to on a system.

    mkdir -p helloworld_1.0-1/usr/local/bin
    cp "~/Projects/Hello World/helloworld" helloworld_1.0-1/usr/local/bin

Now create a special metadata file with which the package manager will install your program...

    mkdir helloworld_1.0-1/DEBIAN
    gedit helloworld_1.0-1/DEBIAN/control

Put something like this in that file...

    Package: helloworld
    Version: 1.0-1
    Section: base
    Priority: optional
    Architecture: i386
    Depends: libsomethingorrather (>= 1.2.13), anotherDependency (>= 1.2.6)
    Maintainer: Your Name <you@email.com>
    Description: Hello World
         When you need some sunshine, just run this
         small program!

    (the space before each line in the description is important)

First, change the ownership of all files to root:

    chown -R root:root helloworld_1.0-1/

Now you just need to make the package:

    dpkg-deb --build helloworld_1.0-1



Bonus step: add it to an existing APT repository:



If youâ€™re hosting your own APT repository,
you can use the following command to add your new .deb package
to the repository (to a distribution called production):

    reprepro -b /path/to/repo includedeb production helloworld_1.0-1.deb
